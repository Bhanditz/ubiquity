  <h2 class="top">What is Ubiquity?</h2>

  <p>Ubiquity is a Firefox add-on that lets you give <b>commands</b> to
  Firefox by entering command words into a special input box.</p>
  <p>Commands are shortcuts for things that you commonly do on
  the Web; they can eliminate repetitive tasks and let you get more done,
  faster.</p>
  <p>The coolest thing about Ubiquity is that <i>anyone</i> can write a
  command and share it with the rest of the world, in much the same way as
  the Web itself lets everyone write pages and share information with the rest
  of the world.</p>

  <!-- TODO: The empty version span below should be automatically filled later.
       However, this functionality was removed at some point between 0.1.8
       and 0.5 when about.js was removed. cmdlist.js now contains a commented
       out section of code to set the version number, but there is a TODO to
       make it apply that version number in all spots on all pages that use
       the version class. Commenting out until that is fixed. -->

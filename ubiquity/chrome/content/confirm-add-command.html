<p>You are about to subscribe to a Ubiquity command from an unknown, untrusted
third-party source

<script>
document.write( "at <a href=\"" + gCommandFeedInfo.url + "\">" +
                gCommandFeedInfo.url + "</a>");
</script>
.</p>

<p>If you subscribe, this command could do <i>anything it wants</i> to your browser.
It could steal your credit card number or e-mail your grandmother your entire image
browsing history.</p>

<p>If you understand JavaScript, you can read
<script>
document.write( "<a href=\"" +
                 gCommandFeedInfo.sourceUrl +
                 "\">the command's source code</a>");
</script>
before you make a decision on whether to subscribe to it or not.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you should not subscribe to the command unless this link was given to
you by someone you know and trust.</p>

<div class="todo" style="border-style:solid; border-width:2px; margin:50px; padding:10px; border-color:#ffff00"><p><i>In the future, we plan to have a widget here
  displaying what we call a &quot;social trust network&quot;.  You'll be able
  to see whether any of your friends have tried out this command.  They can
  either vouch for the command's safety or leave a warning about the command's
  dangers.  We hope this will help people make informed decisions about whether
  to subscribe to commands or not.  This feature should be coming in Ubiquity 0.2.

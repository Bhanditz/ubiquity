	  <p>You are about to subscribe to a <a href="about:ubiquity">Ubiquity</a> command from an unknown, untrusted third-party source at <a id="targetLink"></a>. If you subscribe, this command could do <i>anything it wants</i> to your browser. It could steal your credit card number or e-mail your grandmother your entire image browsing history.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="errorLongDesc">
<p>Here is the JavaScript source code to the command:</p>

<iframe id="jsIframe" width="80%"></iframe>

<p>If you understand JavaScript, you should read this and use your
best judgement to decide whether the command is something that's safe
to execute or not. Proceed at your own risk!</p>
<p>If you don't understand JavaScript, you should not subscribe to the
command unless the link was given to you by someone you know and
trust.</p>
<div class="todo" style="border-style:solid; border-width:2px; width:80%; padding:10px; border-color:#ffff00"><p><i>In the future, we plan to have a widget here
  displaying what we call a &quot;social trust network&quot;.  You'll be able
  to see whether any of your friends have tried out this command.  They can
  either vouch for the command's safety or leave a warning about the command's
  dangers.  We hope this will help people make informed decisions about whether
  to subscribe to commands or not.  This feature should be coming in Ubiquity 0.2.

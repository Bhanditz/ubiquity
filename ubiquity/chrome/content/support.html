    <h2 class="top">Getting Help</h2>
    <p>Due to Ubiquity's unusual nature as a Labs experiment, you may
    run into problems while using it.  There are a number of places you can go for help with Ubiquity.</p>
    <p><a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/mozilla/products/mozilla_ubiquity">Get Satisfaction</a> is a community-driven support site.  Many common problems already have answers there, and if you can't find an answer, you can start a new topic.</p>
	<p>The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ubiquity-firefox">Google Group/Mailing List</a> is useful for discussion of command development, user interface, feature suggestions, and other high-level discussions.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity">Ubiquity Wiki</a> has information about the entire Ubiquity project, including documentation, tutorials, and links to older versions of Ubiquity.</p>

  <div class="col-four">
    <h2 class="top">Report a Bug</h2>
    <p>If you have found a reproduceable error in Ubiquity, you can use the <a href="chrome://ubiquity/content/report-bug.html">bug report form</a> to report it.  Please include any information you have about how to reproduce the bug.</p>
    <h2>Resetting Ubiquity</h2>
    <p>If Ubiquity becomes completely unresponsive to you, then it may be necessary to reset it to its "factory defaults" in order to use it again.  To do this, click <a
    href="reset.html">here</a>&mdash;and our apologies for the inconvenience!</p>

<p id="old-firefox-version" class="warning">You appear to be running
Firefox 3 or earlier, which means that any logging messages or
errors produced by your Jetpacks will reference the wrong line numbers.
This makes debugging Jetpacks difficult; please consider using <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">Firefox 3.5
Beta</a>.</p>
<p id="firebug-not-found" class="warning">You either don't have the
latest version of Firebug installed, or you don't have it enabled for
this page, so all logging messages will appear in the <span
class="logging-source"></span>. If you get <a
href="http://getfirebug.com/releases/index.html">Firebug 1.4 Alpha</a>
and enable it for this page, and then reload this page, all logging
messages will be logged to the Firebug Console, where it's much easier
to debug problems and inspect live objects.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
  <h2>This is a very special page.</h2>
  <p>This page actually houses the Jetpack platform. All your Jetpacks
  are loaded in this page, and you can even use Firebug to inspect
  their current state.</p>
  <p>As a result, the lifetime of your Jetpacks is tied to the
  lifetime of this page. When you reload this page, for instance, all
  your Jetpacks are reloaded. This means that the time between making
  a change to a Jetpack and seeing its effects is as small as
  possible&mdash;you never have to restart your browser.</p>
  <p>Because it only makes sense for one instance of Jetpack to exist
  at a time, this page is what developers call a <i>singleton</i>:
  only one instance of it can exist at once.  Try opening this URL in
  two tabs at once and see what happens!</p>
  <p>Finally, the Jetpack singleton always exists, since users
  obviously need to be able to use their Jetpacks without having
  Jetpack open in a tab.  If you close the Jetpack tab, it'll actually
  re-open in a hidden browser that you can't see.</p>
</div>
<h1>I am Jetpack.</h1>
<p>If you want to create a Jetpack feed, use the <a
href="chrome://ubiquity/content/editor.html">Ubiquity Command
Editor</a> and set the feed type to "Jetpack"; to effect your changes,
just reload any webpage or activate and then dismiss the Ubiquity
command prompt&mdash;no saving is necessary.</p>
<p>Here's a <span class="buttony" id="display-sample">sample Jetpack
feed</span> to get you started. We'll have a real tutorial up soon.</p>
<div id="sample-code" class="sample code"
  style="display: none;">Jetpack.statusBar.append({
  html: "&lt;p&gt;kill flash&lt;/p&gt;",
  onLoad: function(panel) {
    var button = $(panel).find("p");
    button.css({cursor: "pointer", fontFamily: "sans-serif"});
    button.click(function() {
      var doc = $(Application.activeWindow.activeTab.document);
      doc.find("embed[type=application\\/x-shockwave-flash]").slideUp();
    });
  }});
</div>
<p>If you want to hack on the Jetpack platform itself, the vast
majority of it is contained in the <span class="buttony"
id="this-page-source-code">source code for this page</span>. Just make
local changes to the file or one of the scripts it refers to and
reload this page.</p>
<h2>Installed Jetpacks</h2>
<p>These are the Jetpacks that are currently installed.</p>
<div id="jetpacks"></div>
<h2>Memory Usage</h2>
<p>Below is a list of all live objects being tracked by Jetpack. If
one of these numbers never goes down, then your Jetpack either has a
memory leak or isn't using memory very effectively.</p>
<div id="extension-weakrefs"></div>
<p>
  <span class="buttony" id="force-gc">force garbage collection</span>
</p>
<h2>Test Suites</h2>
<p>At the moment, you can run the <span class="buttony"
id="run-tests">Jetpack platform test suite</span>. In the future,
you'll be able to run the test suites for individual Jetpacks
here.</p>
<p>All output for the suites is sent to the <span
class="logging-source"></span>.</p>

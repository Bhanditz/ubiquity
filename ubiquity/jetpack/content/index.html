    <p><i>Exploring new ways to extend &amp; personalize the Web.</i></p>
    
    <p>The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">add-ons community for Firefox</a>
      is arguably one of the largest, most vibrant sources for innovation on the Web today.
      If you want to affect people, to reach them and make a difference in their daily lives,
      the Firefox <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Developing_add-ons">add-ons platform</a>
      is hard to beat, with over
      <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2008/11/19/1-billion-add-on-downloads/">one billion installs
      of Firefox add-ons to date</a>.
    </p>

    <p>However, we've only scratched the surface of its potential.</p>

    <p>Jetpack lets you build Firefox (and more!) extensions with the same skill-set you already know
      from building on the open Web: Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We've even got jQuery included by
      default to ease you into it.</p>

  <!-- DEVELOP -->
  
  <div id="develop">
    <p id="old-firefox-version" class="warning">You appear to be running
    Firefox 3 or earlier, which means that any logging messages or
    errors produced by your Jetpacks will reference the wrong line numbers.
    This makes debugging Jetpacks difficult; please consider using <a
    href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">Firefox 3.5
    Beta</a>.</p>
    <p id="firebug-not-found" class="warning">You either don't have the
    latest version of Firebug installed, or you don't have it enabled for
    this page, so all logging messages will appear in the <span
    class="logging-source"></span>. If you get <a
    href="http://getfirebug.com/releases/index.html">Firebug 1.4 Alpha</a>
    and enable it for this page, and then reload this page, all logging
    messages will be logged to the Firebug Console, where it's much easier
    to debug problems and inspect live objects.</p>
    
    <div class="sidebar">
      <h2>This is a very special page.</h2>
      <p>This page actually houses the Jetpack platform. All your Jetpacks
      are loaded in this page, and you can even use Firebug to inspect
      their current state.</p>
      <p>As a result, the lifetime of your Jetpacks is tied to the
      lifetime of this page. When you reload this page, for instance, all
      your Jetpacks are reloaded. This means that the time between making
      a change to a Jetpack and seeing its effects is as small as
      possible&mdash;you never have to restart your browser.</p>
      <p>Because it only makes sense for one instance of Jetpack to exist
      at a time, this page is what developers call a <i>singleton</i>:
      only one instance of it can exist at once.  Try opening this URL in
      two tabs at once and see what happens!</p>
      <p>Finally, the Jetpack singleton always exists, since users
      obviously need to be able to use their Jetpacks without having
      Jetpack open in a tab.  If you close the Jetpack tab, it'll actually
      re-open in a hidden browser that you can't see.</p>
  
      <h3>API Documentation</h3>
      <p>Read the <a href="chrome://ubiquity/content/file.html#index.html#jetpack/content/js/jetpack-library-doc.js">Jetpack Library documentation</a>.</p>

    <h2>Developing With Jetpack</h2>
    
    <p>If you want to create a Jetpack feed, use the <a
    href="chrome://ubiquity/content/editor.html">Ubiquity Command
    Editor</a> and set the feed type to "Jetpack"; to effect your changes,
    just reload any webpage or activate and then dismiss the Ubiquity
    command prompt&mdash;no saving is necessary.</p>
    <p>Here's a <span class="buttony" id="display-sample">sample Jetpack
    feed</span> to get you started. We'll have a real tutorial up soon.</p>
    <div id="sample-code" class="sample code"
      style="display: none;">Jetpack.statusBar.append({
      html: "&lt;p&gt;kill flash&lt;/p&gt;",
      onLoad: function(panel) {
        var button = $(panel).find("p");
        button.css({cursor: "pointer", fontFamily: "sans-serif"});
        button.click(function() {
          var doc = $(Jetpack.tabs.focused.contentDocument);
          doc.find("embed[type=application\\/x-shockwave-flash]").slideUp();
        });
      }});
    </div>
    
    <p>If you want to hack on the Jetpack platform itself, the vast
    majority of it is contained in the <span class="buttony"
    id="this-page-source-code">source code for this page</span>. Just make
    local changes to the file or one of the scripts it refers to and
    reload this page.</p>

  <!-- MEMORY -->
  
  <div id="memory">
    <h2>Memory Usage</h2>
    <p>Below is a list of all live objects being tracked by Jetpack. If
    one of these numbers never goes down, then your Jetpack either has a
    memory leak or isn't using memory very effectively.</p>
    <div id="extension-weakrefs"></div>
    <p id="memory-usage-actions"p>
      <span class="buttony" id="force-gc">force garbage collection</span>
    </p>

  <div id="installed">

    <p>These are the Jetpack Features that are currently installed.</p>
    <div id="jetpacks"></div>
    <p>You can manage these at <a
    href="chrome://ubiquity/content/cmdlist.html">Ubiquity Commands</a>.</p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- TESTS -->
  
  <div id="tests">
    <h2>Test Suites</h2>
    <p>At the moment, you can run the <span class="buttony"
    id="run-tests">Jetpack platform test suite</span>. In the future,
    you'll be able to run the test suites for individual Jetpacks
    here.</p>
    <p>All output for the suites is sent to the <span
    class="logging-source"></span>.</p>

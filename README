Installing Ubiquity
-------------------

To install Ubiquity to your default Firefox profile, just enter the
root directory of your Ubiquity source code checkout and run:

  python manage.py install

If you have a separate profile that you'd prefer to install the
extension under, such as 'testing', you can add that as an optional
parameter:

  python manage.py install testing

Using Ubiquity
--------------

Once Ubiquity has been installed, you should be able to start up
Firefox and press Ctrl+Space or Alt+Space (depending on your OS).  A
command entry window should pop up, which--for the time being--is the
primary way through which Ubiquity commands are entered. Now type
'help' and press enter.  The page that shows up should guide you from
there.

Uninstalling Ubiquity
---------------------

Just run "python manage.py uninstall", optionally specifying a profile
name/directory if necessary.

Test Suite
----------

Once the extension is installed, the Ubiquity test suite can be run at:

  chrome://ubiquity/content/test.html

Alternatively, the suite can be run from the command-line with:

  python manage.py test

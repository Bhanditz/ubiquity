  <title>Ubiquity 0.1.1 Update Information</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>We've just released the first patch for Ubiquity, which fixes a
  lot of bugs and offers a few new features.  Feel free to check out the <a
  href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1.1_Release_Notes">release
  notes</a> for more information.</p>

  <p>One caveat, though: the latest version may break your current
  subscriptions, and you may have to unsubscribe from them and then
  resubscribe to them to get them to work again.  Sorry for the
  inconvenience, and thanks for participating in this Mozilla Labs
  experiment.</p>
